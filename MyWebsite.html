     <p class=Text1> Petros Paplomatas was born in Katerini, Greece in 1987. He received his diploma in 2011 from the Biomedical Sciences Department of the School of Health Sciences of the International Hellenic University-IHU. He received his M.Sc. diploma in Biomedical and Molecular Sciences in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases in 2021 from the Department of Medicine at Democritus University of Thrace. He received his second Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Neuroinformatics in 2023 from the Hellenic Open University. He is now a Ph.D. candidate at Ionian University's department of informatics. His research interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biology. His research focuses on developing novel artificial intelligence or feature selection algorithms for the identification of potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of web interactive applications for this purpose.
