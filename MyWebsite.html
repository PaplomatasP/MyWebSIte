     <p class=Text1> Petros Paplomatas was born in Katerini, Greece in 1987. He received his diploma in 2011 from the Biomedical Sciences Department of the School of Health Sciences of the International Hellenic University-IHU. He received his M.Sc. diploma in Biomedical and Molecular Sciences in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases in 2021 from the Department of Medicine at Democritus University of Thrace. He received his second Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Neuroinformatics in 2023 from the Hellenic Open University. He is now a Ph.D. candidate at Ionian University's department of informatics. His research interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biology. His research focuses on developing novel artificial intelligence or feature selection algorithms for the identification of potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and the development of web interactive applications for this purpose.

  <li> <a href="http://212.227.75.194:8447/"> ScGenesElite: </a>A tool-guide for the identification of more robust genes-level drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases. </li> 
  <p>This application offers a flexible platform for the identification of dominant genes in a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset that operate as disease biomarkers.
It uses statistical, machine-learning, and cutting-edge feature selection approaches for scRNA-seq data.
The feature selection operation modes include 20 different methodologies, covering a broad range of such approaches. The extracted gene list is further examined for enrichment in various biological and pharmacological features.
A heatmap according to the cell type or the disease state, an enrichment analysis, KEGG molecular pathways, PPI networks, and similarity graphs could be generated from isolated genes to provide a better understanding of the potential biomarkers and molecular interactions that are involved.</p>
